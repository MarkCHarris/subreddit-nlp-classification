    "The aim of this project is to identify differences in the discourse among scientist vs among members of the general public who have shown enthusiasm for human advancement.  NLP will be used to examine differences between posts on the Science and Futurology subreddits, and classification models will be used to attempt to identify which subreddit posts were from.  The classification models will be evaluated based primarily on F1 score, to ensure that they are not skewed towards one subreddit.  Other scores considered will be precision, recall, and ROC AUC.\n",
